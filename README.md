A search squad can find people by simply searching for victims using this app which allows the trapped person to host a connection (mobile hotspot).

Lets move to a more simple scenario where the people want to circulate a piece of information to the search squad helping them to locate victim or requesting them to share any information about a victim. This app enables them to share a forum which does not allow duplicate information nor spam the forum. Basic categories such as location and needs can be put for in the forum.
